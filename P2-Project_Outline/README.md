# Project Outline

## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/assignments/project-outline/)

## Overview
My project is a meal planner that will allow users to view (and probably print out) a grocery list from a meal plan.  Users can create, edit, and delete meal plans, recipes, and ingredients.

I decided to make this project mostly for my sister, who is a stay-at-home mom with 1 cute kid and another on the way. Without the help of online tools (because lets face it, your favorite recipes are not all in the same recipe box or book or online website), it requires a lot of time and effort to plan the weekly meals  - including double checking what you have and referecing books and family recipe cards - to then finally arrive to a grocery list

## Features

## What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn about many-to-many data relationships in Spring Boot including queries and sorting.
